## Implemented Features
a.	Inclusive and accessible design: High contrast colors and large fonts have been utilized throughout the app to ensure readability for a wide range of users. 
All interactive elements have been designed with clear labels, large touch targets and the included texts work with iOS’s integrated voice over technology.

b.	Library of pre-created customizable positive and routine-focused stories: There are currently 3 base stories, 2 relevant to this implementation checkpoint. 
The stories are positive, simple, easy to read and were sourced from both the participant and opensource stories on the internet. 
The adult view of the stories page allows for character name and gender customizations.

c.	Separate interfaces for child and adult: The adult’s interface provide more control over the customization of story characters, 
allowing them to adjust the content to suit their child’s story needs. The app opens directly to the child interface as they are the primary users of this app. 
The child interface contains a button leading to the adult view, which contains an “age verifier” to ensure that the younger users aren’t accessing the view without permission. 

d.	Child friendly UI: The base user interface consists of large buttons, simple words, vibrant colors, minimal text, and intuitive navigation. 
This would help guarantee usability, keep the younger users engaged and promote independent interaction with the app.
